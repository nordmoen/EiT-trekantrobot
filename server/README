To run install Node.js (nodejs.org), once complete install Socket.io with command
"npm install socket.io". After this run the server with "node server.js".

The server accepts two optional command-line arguments, the first is the
IP address to bind to, if this is not present defaults to 127.0.0.1. The other
parameter which is dependant on the first is the port.

"node server.js 127.0.0.1 8080" is an example with the standard IP and a different
port.
